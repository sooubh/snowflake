# LedgerShield: Unified Supply Chain Platform for Healthcare & Public Distribution

## The Problem: Siloed Data Leads to Empty Shelves

**Hospitals, public distribution systems (PSD), and NGOs struggle to keep medicines, food, and other essentials available in the right place at the right time.**

### Why This Happens

Data on sales/usage, inventory, and purchase orders often lives in **separate systems**:
- 📊 Sales data in one Excel sheet
- 📦 Inventory in another system  
- 📝 Purchase orders on paper or emails
- ❌ **No unified view**

**Result**: Teams spot stock issues only when **shelves are already empty or overfull**.

### The Cost
