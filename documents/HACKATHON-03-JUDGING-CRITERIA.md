## Presentation Strategy

### Opening (30 seconds)
**Hook with Impact**:
> "₹6,000 Crores of medicines wasted. 20% stock-outs in clinics. We're solving this."

**Emphasize**: Problem urgency + Scale

**Demonstrate All 4 Criteria**:
1. Innovation: Multi-stakeholder demo
2. Impact: Show metrics and SDGs
3. Technical: Live platform demo
4. Business: Revenue model slide

### Closing (30 seconds)

## Common Weaknesses to Avoid

❌ **Too Technical**: Judges may not be developers
✅ **Solution**: Focus on impact, use simple language

❌ **No Business Model**: "We'll figure it out later"
✅ **Solution**: Clear pricing, revenue projections

❌ **Vague Impact**: "We'll help people"
✅ **Solution**: Specific numbers, SDG alignment

❌ **Demo Failure**: Technical issues
✅ **Solution**: Backup demo video, practice 10+ times

❌ **Ignoring Questions**: "I don't know"
✅ **Solution**: Prepare for 20+ common questions

---

## Red Flags to Address Proactively

### "Is this just another inventory system?"
**Response**: "No. Healthcare-specific with expiry tracking, multi-stakeholder support, and SDG-aligned impact. General inventory tools don't prevent medicine wastage."

### "How will you compete with established players?"
**Response**: "Legacy systems are expensive, outdated, single-sector. We're affordable, modern, multi-stakeholder. Plus, export feature is unique."

### "Can you really scale?"
**Response**: "Azure cloud architecture, proven tech stack (Next.js + Cosmos DB), partition strategy. Same tech powering billion-user platforms."

### "What about data privacy?"
**Response**: "Azure enterprise security, role-based access, data isolation, audit trails. HIPAA-ready architecture for US expansion."
