## 🎯 The Winning Formula

### **Opening (First 30 seconds)**
```
"Good morning! We're [Team Name], and we're solving 
a ₹6,000 Crore problem that's costing lives across India. 

30% of medicines expire unused while 20% of clinics 
face critical stock-outs. 

We built MedChain - an AI-powered platform that 
connects government, hospitals, and NGOs to eliminate 
this waste and save lives.

Let me show you..."
```

### **The Hook (Problem Slide)**
Make them FEEL the problem:
- "Imagine a diabetic patient rushing to a rural clinic..."
- "₹6,000 Crores - that's $700 million - going to waste every year..."
- "While medicines expire on one shelf, patients die from stock-outs 100km away..."

### **The Demo (Make It Memorable)**
- Keep it fast: Search → Add → Invoice in 30 seconds
- Show real impact: "What took 3 days now takes 30 seconds"
- Let them see the AI: Export with one click

### **The Vision (Inspire)**
```
"This isn't just software. This is infrastructure for 
equitable healthcare. 

In 5 years, MedChain will connect 100,000 facilities 
across 20 countries, preventing ₹10,000 Crores in 
wastage globally.

Because every medicine that expires unused is a patient 
who couldn't access it."
```
