### 2-3 Real Use Cases (Detailed)

#### USE CASE 1: Preventing Emergency Stock-Out

**Characters:**
- Hospital A (City General, 300 beds)
- PHC Rampur (rural, 50km away)

Day 15: Only 10 vials left, consumption rate: 2/day
        MedChain AI predicts: "Stock-out in 5 days"
        → Auto-PO generated for 100 vials
        → Sent to approved vendor
        
Day 17: Vendor delivers 100 vials to PHC
        Stock never ran out

Alternative (Without MedChain):
Day 20: Stock runs out
        → Patient arrives needing insulin
        → "Sorry, out of stock"

### Why We're NOT Targeting "Everyone"

**Avoided Mistakes:**
❌ "Our target market is everyone who needs inventory management"
❌ "Retailers, manufacturers, hospitals, schools..."
❌ "B2B and B2C"

**Our Focused Approach:**
✓ Healthcare sector ONLY
✓ Three specific segments (PSD, Hospital, NGO)
✓ Each has unique pain points we solve
✓ Deep understanding, not shallow broad approach

## What to Say (45 seconds)

> "Who exactly uses MedChain? Three very specific segments.
>
> **Government medical stores** - 750 districts across India. Meet Mr. Rajesh, District Medical Officer in Rampur, UP. He manages 50 PHCs and dreads month-end audits. With MedChain, his compliance reports go from 3 days to 30 seconds.
>
> **Hospitals** - 70,000 hospitals and 8 lakh pharmacies. Dr. Priya Shah runs the pharmacy at City General. She was losing ₹25 lakhs annually on expired medicines. With our 90-day expiry alerts, she's cut that by 80%.
>
> **NGOs** - Thousands of medical relief organizations. Sanjay runs mobile health camps. His donors ask 'Where did our ₹10 lakh donation go?' Now he shows them: '200 beneficiaries served, 1,500 medicines distributed, here are the photos' - instant donor reports.
>
> We're not targeting 'everyone.' We're laser-focused on healthcare supply chain - government transparency, hospital efficiency, and NGO impact. That's our expertise."
