## Content Details

### The Numbers (Top Section)
**Large, Bold Statistics:**
1. **₹6,000 Crores** - Medicine wastage annually in India alone
2. **30%** - Percentage of medicines that expire unused
3. **20%** - Stock-out rate at rural healthcare facilities

### Who Is Facing This Problem?

**Three Critical Groups:**

#### 🏛️ Government (Public Supply Depots)
- 750+ district medical stores
- 30,000+ Primary Health Centers
- **Problem**: "Where did 10,000 tablets disappear to?" - No digital trail

#### 🏥 Hospitals
- 70,000+ hospitals across India
- **Problem**: Surgery cancelled because sterile gloves expired. Patient family scrambles to buy from outside at 3x price.

#### 🤝 NGOs
- Thousands of medical relief organizations
- **Problem**: Donor asks "Where did my ₹10 lakhs donation go?" - No proper documentation, funding at risk.

### Why Is This Painful?

**The Pain Points (Bullet format):**

1. **Manual Tracking = Chaos**
   - 10 different registers to maintain
   - Excel sheets full of errors
   - 3-5 days to generate one report

2. **Zero Visibility**
   - "Do we have medicine X?" - Takes 2 hours to find out
   - No expiry alerts - discover expired stock too late
   - Can't track distribution to sub-centers

3. **Financial Hemorrhage**
   - Hospitals lose ₹20-50 lakhs annually on expired medicines
   - Government programs waste 30% of budget
   - NGOs can't prove impact, lose future funding

4. **Lives at Stake**
   - Patient arrives with heart attack - "Sorry, aspirin out of stock"
   - Diabetic camp cancelled - insulin expired
   - Emergency response delayed - can't locate supplies

### What Happens If Not Solved?

**The Spiral Effect:**
```
Medicine Waste → Budget Loss → Less Procurement → Stock-Outs
                                                        ↓
                                              Patients Suffer
                                                        ↓
                                              Lives Lost
```

### Real-World Story (Optional Text Box)

```
"A Truth That Hits Home"

Mrs. Sharma rushed her diabetic husband to the rural 
clinic. The doctor prescribed insulin - but the clinic 
was out of stock. By the time they reached a city 
hospital 100km away, it was too late.

Meanwhile, 500 insulin vials expired unused at the 
district medical store just 20km from the clinic.

This happens every day across India.

## What to Say (45 seconds)

> "Let me paint you a picture of the crisis we're solving.
>
> Every year in India, ₹6,000 Crores worth of medicines - that's over $700 million - expire unused. That's 30% of all government medical procurement going to waste.
>
> Meanwhile, 20% of rural clinics face critical stock-outs. Diabetic patients can't get insulin. Emergency medicines are unavailable when needed most.
>
> Who's suffering? Three groups:
>
> **Government medical stores** - they can't track where medicines go. CAG audits are nightmares. Public trust is eroding.
>
> **Hospitals** - imagine a surgery cancelled because surgical gloves expired. The patient family has to buy from outside at triple the price. This happens daily.
>
> **NGOs** - they receive ₹10 lakhs in medicine donations, but can't prove to donors how it was used. Future funding dries up.
>
> The root cause? Manual, paper-based tracking. No real-time visibility. No alerts. No accountability.
>
> And the cost isn't just financial. When medicines expire while patients suffer stock-outs - **people die**."
