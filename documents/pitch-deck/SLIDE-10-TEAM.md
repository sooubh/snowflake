## Design Tips

**Layout:**
- Professional team photos (not selfies!)
- Clean, minimal design
- Contact info clearly visible

**Photos:**
- Team photo together (shows cohesion)
- Individual headshots (professional)
- Smiling, confident (not serious/stern)

**Text:**
- Keep skills brief (3-4 bullet points max)
- Focus on "why this person" not resume dump
- Highlight complementary skills

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Too much text (resume-like)
- ❌ Generic skills ("hardworking", "team player")
- ❌ Unrelated experience (childhood achievements)

**Emphasize:**
- ✅ Execution proof (what you've built)
- ✅ Complementary skills (complete team)
- ✅ Domain expertise (healthcare knowledge)
- ✅ Commitment (long-term vision)
