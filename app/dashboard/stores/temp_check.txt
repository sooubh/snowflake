// Actually we need to add getItemsAction or similar if we want to be pure.
// But we can import `getAllItems` in a Server Component?
// This is a "use client" component. So we need an action.
// I will create `getStockAction` in `admin.ts`?
// Or I can use `chat.ts` actions? No.
// Let's add `getStockAction` to `admin.ts` first? 
// Or just inline fetch if I can? No, server actions preferred.
// I will assume `getStockAction` exists or I will add it. I'll add `getStockAction` to `admin.ts` in a separate step or just assume I can fetch it via an API route if exists.
// Wait, `app/actions/chat.ts` is mostly for AI.
// I'll update `admin.ts` first to include `getStockAction`.

// Wait, I can't update admin.ts AND write this file in one turn easily.
// I will assume `addStockItemAction` and `deleteStockItemAction` are there.
// For Fetching, I'll use a new action `getStoreItemsAction` which I'll add to admin.ts.

// Let's UPDATE admin.ts FIRST.
